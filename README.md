# bootstrap-boilerplate-22-04

Udated as of April 2022.

This is a template repository for stating a new web page/site. This is useful so I don't have to start from scratch when I build a new web site.

Get started by creating a new respository and using this as the template.

This project is maintained by Mike Vanderpool.

It includes the following files:

```
index.html
CSS/style.css
```

The `index.html` file includes a link to the Bootstrap CDN.
